# Calculator

> My first c++ project

This is for me to learn from, not for other people to learn from!

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```
brew install cmake
```

To compile:

```
cmake .
make
```

To execute:

```
./out/calculator
```

## Tests

This project uses Catch2 for running tests, which is fetched by cmake.

To run, follow compilation steps from above and execute:

```
./out/tests
```

## To do maybe

- Variables (`a = 2` then `2 * a`)
